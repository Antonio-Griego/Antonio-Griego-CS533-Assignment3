# Antonio-Griego-CS533-Assignment3

This is the GitHub code repository for Assignment 3 of CS 533, Experimental Methods in Computer Science.

## compiling and running code

The code I will be running will be in the code subfolder in this repository. It will contain benchmarking code written for C and Java and will be the code used to produce my experimental data.

## sub modules

This repository makes use of Git sub modules to include code from two repositories:

- https://github.com/MartinThoma/matrix-multiplication.git
- https://github.com/gmfricke/CS533_Assignment3_Matmult.git

These code bases serve as starting points and source material for code that I will write and/or adapt.

When downloading and running code from this repository, it will be necessary to run the command
```
git submodule init
```
in order to initialize and downloaded the code from these submodules.
